# Euchre - Big in ON, Canada 🇨🇦

[**Euchre**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euchre) is huge in Canada, but it is **specifically and intensely associated with Ontario**.

Here is the breakdown of its status in Canada:

* **The "National" Game of Ontario:** While not played as universally across the entire country (like hockey is), it is ubiquitous in Ontario. If you grew up in rural Ontario, or even in cities like Toronto in certain communities, learning Euchre is almost a rite of passage.
* **Cultural Roots:** It was likely brought to Canada by the "Pennsylvania Dutch" and United Empire Loyalists who immigrated to Southern Ontario from the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries. This is why it is also very popular in the American Midwest (Michigan, Ohio, Indiana).
* **Social Setting:** It is the standard game for lunch breaks, Legion halls, cottage weekends, and family gatherings.

So, while a British Columbian or a Newfoundlander might not know the rules, if you meet someone from Ontario, there is a very high probability they know exactly what a "left bower" is.
