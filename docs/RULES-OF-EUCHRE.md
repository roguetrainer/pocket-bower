# **The Rules of Euchre**

**Euchre** is a trick-taking card game most commonly played with four people in two partnerships. It is fast-paced, relies heavily on trump suits, and is famous for the "Bower" hierarchy.

## **1\. The Deck**

Euchre is played with a **24-card deck**:

* **Cards:** A, K, Q, J, 10, 9 of all four suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades).  
* *Note: Some variations use a 32-card deck (adding 7s and 8s), but 24 is standard.*

## **2\. Card Rankings**

This is the most critical part of the game. The rank of cards depends on what suit is named **Trump**.

### **The Trump Suit**

In the Trump suit, the ranking is (highest to lowest):

1. **Right Bower:** The Jack of the Trump suit.  
2. **Left Bower:** The Jack of the *same color* as the Trump suit (e.g., if Hearts are Trump, the Jack of Diamonds is the Left Bower). *Note: The Left Bower is considered a member of the Trump suit, not its original suit.*  
3. **Ace** (of Trump)  
4. **King** (of Trump)  
5. **Queen** (of Trump)  
6. **10** (of Trump)  
7. **9** (of Trump)

### **Non-Trump Suits**

In all other suits, the ranking is standard: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9\.  
(Remember: If a Jack is the Left Bower, it is no longer part of its original suit).

## **3\. Setup**

* **Players:** 4 players, split into two teams of two. Partners sit opposite each other.  
* **Score:** The game is usually played to **10 points**.

## **4\. The Deal**

1. Five cards are dealt to each player (usually in packets of 2 and 3).  
2. The remaining four cards are placed face-down in the middle (the "kitty").  
3. The top card of the kitty is flipped face-up. This is the **Up Card**.

## **5\. Bidding (Naming Trump)**

Starting to the dealer's left, players have the option to accept the suit of the Up Card as Trump.

**Round 1:**

* Players can say **"Pick it up"** (ordering the dealer to take the card) or **"Pass"**.  
* If someone says "Pick it up," the dealer adds the Up Card to their hand and discards one card face-down. The suit of the Up Card becomes Trump.  
* If everyone passes, the Up Card is turned face-down, and Round 2 begins.

**Round 2:**

* Starting to the dealer's left, players can name **any suit** (except the one that was just turned down) as Trump.  
* If all players pass again, the hand is usually a "misfit" and thrown in to be redealt by the next dealer.  
  * *Variation: "Stick the Dealer" \- The dealer is forced to name a trump if everyone passes in Round 2\.*

**Going Alone (Loner):**

* If a player thinks they can take all 5 tricks without their partner, they can say **"I'm going alone."**  
* The partner places their cards face-down and sits out the hand.

## **6\. Gameplay**

1. The player to the dealer's left leads the first card.  
2. Play proceeds clockwise.  
3. **Must Follow Suit:** If you have a card of the suit led, you *must* play it. (Remember: The Left Bower is the Trump suit).  
4. If you cannot follow suit, you may play any card (including a Trump card to win the trick).  
5. **Winning the Trick:** The highest Trump played wins. If no Trump is played, the highest card of the led suit wins.  
6. The winner of the trick leads the next card.

## **7\. Scoring**

The team that chose Trump is the **Makers**. The other team is the **Defenders**.

* **Makers win 3 or 4 tricks:** 1 Point.  
* **Makers win all 5 tricks (A March):** 2 Points.  
* **Makers win all 5 tricks on a "Loner":** 4 Points.  
* **Euchred (Makers fail to take 3 tricks):** Defenders get 2 Points.
